#Why do i code?
I have always been interested in the Information Technology.My first computer was Atari 65 XE 
(I know that they would like to live dinosaurs :D). But Railways have directed me in a different 
direction, but I had contact with computers.Today I can afford it to deal with what I have always 
dreamed about because I have been learning programming for a year. At the beginning I started to 
learn JAVA, but after a month I switched to PYTHON. In December last year I learned about MOTOROLA
ACADEMY and I thought it would be a way for me. I still wanted to say that about C # 
(except that it exists) I did not know anything.I started to learn it only two days ago.
